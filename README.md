# Telecom_churn
A telecom company is concerned about their higher churn rate. This project is aimed at developing a model which would answer a few key questions of interest to roll out targeted proactive retention programs, which would help in reducing the churn rate. 
Used Logistic Regression to develop a model with appreciable accuracy that predicted customer churns on the data collected by the company. The model was then used to derive insights from the data which could help in planning better retention offers and plans.
